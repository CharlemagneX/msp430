AB2 MSP430 Project Examples
===========================

Example projects that demonstrate our libraries can be found here. For the most part, they won't be all that useful other than to show off some cool stuff to do with our libraries.

Each project has a relative symbolic link for includes called 'include' that points to its device-specific include folder. These links will work out of the box on Linux machines, but will need to be re-created on Windows machines. We're looking for a good cross-platform mechanism here, but everything we've tried seems to crash and burn. If anyone has ideas please let us know.

Have a great day and enjoy!
