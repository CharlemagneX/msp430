AB2 MSP430 Libraries
====================

MSP430 libraries developed by AB2Tech. We will be rolling these out as we are able to iterate through our software and prepare it for distribution.

Each device we support has a specific directory here in the include directory. Within each device-specific directory, there will be a relative link to the global includes directory. These links will work out of the box on Linux machines, but will need to be re-created on Windows machines. We're looking for a good cross-platform mechanism here, but everything we've tried seems to crash and burn. If anyone has ideas please let us know.

Enjoy!
