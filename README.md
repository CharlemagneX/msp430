msp430
======

Please visit our site for more awesome stuff!
http://www.ab2tech.com

This repository is a collection of our tested msp430 libraries and examples. The
[include](include) directory contains the libraries, and the [src](src)
directory contains the examples.

In the include directory, files included in the root are intended for any msp430
device. These will only be tested for the microcontrollers we are currently
supporting (currently msp430f5510 and msp430f2553). The device-specific
libraries that we provide will be posted in the respective msp430 device folder
inside of the [include](include) folder.

The same is true for the [src](src) directory, with the exception that there
will be nothing in the root of this directory (as each example project is
device-specific).

Enjoy! Please give us your feedback and report any issues you might encounter.
